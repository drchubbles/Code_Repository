# Capstone Project
This project was assigned as part of our programming module at university. We were tasked with creating reusable code, which a builder would use to manage and create his projects. We needed to make it capable of reading a file and creating those projects, tasks to be removable, and projects to be displayed in a folder.
This task was required to prove our competency coding for the module, which this work has done well. It was the most significant solo programming project I had undertaken during programming.
